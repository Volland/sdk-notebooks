    # The video_embed substitution below is essentially a macro to avoid
    # repeating all of the YouTube embed code for each video in the book.
    # The %%VID%% part of the src attribute is replaced by the YouTube video
    # id at each place where a video is linked in the textbook source.
    video_embed: '<div class="container16x9"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/%%VID%%" class="responsive-iframe" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>'
    # Macros for exercises. It's tricky to get these to work for both HTML
    # and PDF. If you make any changes, be sure to check both outputs. If you
    # change the star symbol, make sure to change it at the end of chapter 1,
    # too.

    solutions: |
      Solutions to most exercises are <a href="https://github.com/cs3110/textbook-solutions">available</a>.
      Fall 2022 is the first public release of these solutions.
      Though they have been available to Cornell students for a few years,
      it is inevitable that wider circulation will reveal improvements that
      could be made. We are happy to add or correct solutions. Please make
      contributions through GitHub.

# Welcome to Self Sovereign Identity with Affinidi SDK
I assume that you already know some basics of SSI if not we will discover few key ideas in this book and videos.
This book is just compilation of ipython notebooks that could be independently run for every topic. 
Each character has a youtube videos that explain a topic it self and hands on code based on affinidi sdk.
## Why SSI and web5

In 2005, Microsoft's Chief Identity Architect, Kim Cameron wrote an influential paper called [The Laws of Identity](https://www.identityblog.com/stories/2005/05/13/TheLawsOfIdentity.pdf) (PDF). Kim had been talking about and formulating these laws in 2004 and throughout 2005. It's no coincidence that Internet Identity Workshop got started in 2005. Many people were talking about user-centric identity and developing ideas about how we might be able to create an identity layer for the Internet. Fifteen years later, we're still at it, but getting closer and closer all the time. (c)[laws of identity www.windley.com](https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/01/the_laws_of_identity.shtml) is iconic paper that explain it in details .
